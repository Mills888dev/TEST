Trash can cause many things from air pollution to ground pollution and can be as bad as radiation but that takes a lot of trash and requires less radioactive waste. Trash will always be an issue unless we cull the human race. Within this article we will go over the effect trash has on ecosystems within the contents of air,water, and ground pollution.

Air pollution can cause many things from lung cancer in certain countries, all the way to causing global warming. The main problem of air pollution is that it can cause long-term lung issues to all creatures. This can also cause global warming which is a major issue. The main 3 causes are factories, coal power plants, and cars. 

Ground pollution is another major issue that causes bad crop growth and can infect water supplies. This causes many issues and those issues may cause more, but our main current issue with this is that it causes crops not to grow and can cause issues that cause mental disease, headaches, and such similar. This is all usually caused by mismanaged waste and the main problem is landfills and toxic waste dumps.

Ocean pollution is our 3rd main problem which causes the mass death of various sea creatures. The main problem of this is that it causes sea creatures death via consumption of mismanaged plastics, but it can also cause bad light in the ocean and can cause waste to build up on shores. All of that causes a large amount of shore creatures and sea creatures to die every year and it's only getting worse. The main culprit of this is waste mismanagement and micro plastics. All of those get stuck inside of animals stomachs and due to plastic being hard to degrade just sits there and chokes the animals.


Our current solution right now is to “rake” the oceans with large barges. Currently our methods are highly inefficient. Right now we are looking at ways of using microbes that can eat plastic and using them to degrade and destroy the plastic in our oceans and landfills.

Now I hope you learned something about trash and how it affects our environment. Now I hope you are more cautious about what you do with your waste because now you know where it goes and how it affects environments.
