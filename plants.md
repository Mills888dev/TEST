Right now we have tech that can genetically modify plants beyond their normal abilities. Currently we only found how to amplify specific traits of plants. Within this article we hope to inform you on what genetically engineered plants do and where it is at right now.

Currently right now we canâ€™t do very much with this. The reason for this is because of how new doing something like this is. Currently we have only done minor things to change plants to help with pollution and it is that we made a plant that amplifies the air purification properties of a plant by over 40x.

Currently genetically modifying plants to help with the environment is in its early stages. Due to that it causes information on this to be uncommon but hopefully within 10-20 years it might become common to use genetically modified plants to filter carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

This research could help with the general management of air pollution and if brought to a large scale could create a near 0 energy carbon to oxygen conversion on mass scale. Genetically engineered plants can also help possibly deal with ground pollution by creating plants that can filter out certain things in the ground. Although this may seem like something that can help with all the problems above it can't help with radiation as of now, because radiation can easily kill these plants due to its properties to break down DNA and go through most materials that certain radiation types have.

The research on this is very lacking so i hope you learned a little bit about this topic. Although I would've loved to have learned more on this, there is currently not a lot of information about altering plants to help the environment. This may have been short but I hope you liked reading this and learned something new.
